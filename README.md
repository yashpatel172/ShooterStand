Personal Project

👉🏻 This project consisted of me attempting to recreate a classic Android game called "Big Time Gangsta" by Glu Games, which was discontinued by the company. I did prototyping to remake the game's core elements, which helped me develop and get familiar with new Unity tools.

👉🏻 I used various tools at my disposal by self learning such as: 

• UI Programming (For Characters , Inventory, Weapon Shop, Spawn Slots)
• Queue System for player spawning system
• Used various skeleton classes and C# concepts such as Lists to create characters stats, weapons stats and more.

👉🏻 Some of the modules from the original game which I successfully implemented were:

• Buying weapons using in-game currency
• Different character unlocks based on the current level of the player
• Equip Weapon/Items System (Inventory) for each characters
• Character Spawn system based on the queue of characters which players assigns at the start of each level.

👉🏻 SOFTWARE: Unity 3D, C#
